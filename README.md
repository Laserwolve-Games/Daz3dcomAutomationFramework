# [Daz3d.com](https://www.daz3d.com/) Framework
## This is an automation framework for [Daz3d.com](https://www.daz3d.com/) written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) libraries and [Microsoft Edge WebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).

Currently, the purpose of this framework is to maximize the amount of free assets you can get out of [Daz3d.com](https://www.daz3d.com/). We are going about that in two ways:

### Automate checking for free assets — Completion: 80%

There is no rhyme or reason to determine when free assets is available on [Daz3d.com](https://www.daz3d.com/). We will make a script that will check if anything free is available, add it to the cart, then checkout.

### Maximum utilization of the monthly [Daz+](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-plus) coupon — Completion: 0%

If you're a [Daz+](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-plus), you'll get a $5 coupon each month, which ironically can't be used on [Daz+](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-plus) assets.

There's no way to search for non-[Daz+](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-plus) assets, so we will write a script that will scroll through the near-infinite asset list, parsing out assets that meet certain qualifications.
